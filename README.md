# chatdinger ðŸ””

An unofficial Chrome extension that adds notification sounds to your AI chatsâ€”because let's be honest, this should just be a built-in feature.

## What it does
Makes your chats go "ding" when responses come in. Currently works for:
- chatgpt.com

More platforms coming eventually (maybe).

## Why unofficial?
There's no point making this an official Chrome Web Store extension when chatgpt.com should really just add this feature themselves. Until they do, here we are.

## Installation

1. **Download**: Click the green "Code" button above â†’ "Download ZIP"
2. **Extract**: Double-click the ZIP file (Mac) or right-click â†’ "Extract All" (Windows)
3. **Move to safety**: Put the unzipped folder somewhere permanent like your Documents folder
4. **Chrome setup**: 
   - Go to `chrome://extensions` in your address bar
   - Toggle on "Developer mode" (top right)
   - Click "Load unpacked" 
   - Select your unzipped chatdinger folder
5. **Enable**: Toggle the extension on
6. **Enjoy**: Your chats now ding âœ¨

## Need help?
If these steps don't make sense, just ask any AI: *"I'm trying to install a Chrome extension from GitHub, help walk me through the steps."*
