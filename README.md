# chatdinger
you know, the unofficial chrome extension that makes chat ding...

currently works for claude.ai and chatgpt.com.

might add more in the future.

there is no sense making this an offical chrome extension because this should really just be a feature native to both the chatters.

to download and install the dinger just hit the green code button, and then the download zip button. 
unzip the thing. to unzip double click on mac, or right click unzip on windows.
move the unzipped folder into somewhere safe like documents. 
go to chrome and type chrome://extensions in the address bar. 
toggle on developer mode.
click load unpacked button and select the unzipped folder you moved to the safe space. 
toggle on the extension. 
and bam. enjoy. 

if that doesn't make sense, just ask claude.ai or whatever ai you dig, "i am trying to install a chrome extension from github, help walk me through the steps. "
