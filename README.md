# Chat Dinger 🔔

A Chrome extension that plays a sound when ChatGPT finishes generating a response.

Switch tabs, do other things, and never miss when your response is ready.

## Install

**[Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chat-dinger-chatgpt-notif/kkpdpkhnioiapldpimpdlleonejkkddb)** (recommended)

Or install from source – see [Development](#development) below.

## Features

- **Sound notifications** – Plays when ChatGPT stops generating
- **Works in background** – Notifies even when the tab is hidden or minimized
- **Mute toggle** – Quick mute button right in the ChatGPT composer
- **Multiple sounds** – Choose from several notification tones
- **Stats tracking** – Tracks your dings, streaks, and "cook time"
- **Remote selectors** – UI detection updates automatically if ChatGPT changes their layout

## Why?

This should be a built-in feature. OpenAI, if you're reading this: please just add this to ChatGPT and put me out of my misery.

Until then, here we are.
